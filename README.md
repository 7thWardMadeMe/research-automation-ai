## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* API keys from Toolhouse and OpenRouter (both have generous free tiers)

### 1. Get Your API Keys

#### Toolhouse Setup (Free - 50 agent runs/month)

1. Sign up at [toolhouse.ai](https://toolhouse.ai)
2. Go to [API Keys](https://app.toolhouse.ai/settings/api-keys) and generate a new key
3. Create a [Bundle](https://app.toolhouse.ai/bundles) called `research_assistant_tools`
4. Add these essential tools to your bundle:

   * **Web search** - for gathering information from the internet
   * **Code Interpreter** - for calculations, data analysis, and processing
   * **Memory (remember)** - for storing insights and preferences
   * **Memory (recall)** - for retrieving stored information
   * **Trends over time** - for tracking patterns and changes

#### OpenRouter Setup (Free - 50-1000 requests/day)

1. Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. No additional setup needed - free models are automatically available

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PowerUpSkills/research-automation-ai.git
cd research-automation-ai

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your API keys
# TOOLHOUSE_API_KEY=your_toolhouse_api_key_here
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
# TIMEZONE_OFFSET=-8  # Optional: your timezone offset
# USER_ID=your_name   # Optional: for personalized responses
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Need help with TIMEZONE\_OFFSET?**
> Set your offset from UTC (e.g., -8 for PST, +1 for CET). Unsure of yours? Use tools like [https://www.utcoffset.net](https://www.utcoffset.net) or search "current UTC offset \[your city]" on your favorite search engine.

### üí° Running in PowerShell vs VS Code

This project was developed and tested on **Windows 11**, using **PowerShell** and **VS Code**. These instructions are beginner-friendly, but feel free to use what works best for your operating system and setup. The goal is to help other new users ‚Äî this just happens to be the setup that worked for me.

#### ‚úÖ Recommended: VS Code Terminal (Beginner Friendly)

1. **Open the project folder** in VS Code:

   * `File > Open Folder...`
   * Select: `research-automation-ai`

2. **Open the Terminal**:

   * Press \`Ctrl + \`\` (backtick)
   * OR: `View > Terminal`

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Run the program**:

   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

#### üíª Alternative: PowerShell Standalone

If you‚Äôre outside VS Code and just using PowerShell:

1. **Navigate to the project folder**:

   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\7thWa\OneDrive\Desktop\local-projects\research-automation-ai"
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Run the program**:

   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

üëç Pro Tip: Always make sure you‚Äôre in the root of your project (where `main.py`, `.env`, and `requirements.txt` are located) before running commands.

### 4. Run Your Research Assistant

```bash
# Start the interactive CLI
python main.py
```
